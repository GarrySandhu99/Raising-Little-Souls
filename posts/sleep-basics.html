          Sleep can feel like the biggest challenge in the first year. Here are
          a few <strong>basics</strong> that many families find helpful—no
          strict rules, just options to try.
        </p>
        <h2>Safe sleep matters</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place your baby on their <strong>back</strong> for every sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a <strong>firm, flat</strong> surface with no loose bedding,
            bumpers, or toys.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the room at a <strong>comfortable temperature</strong> and
            avoid overheating.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Day and night</h2>
        <p>
          Newborns don't know day from night yet. You can gently encourage the
          difference:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Day:</strong> More light, normal sounds, interaction.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Night:</strong> Dim lights, quiet, minimal interaction
            during feeds and changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over time this helps their body clock adjust.</p>
        <h2>Routines (when you're ready)</h2>
        <p>
          A short, calm routine before bed can signal "sleep time." It doesn't
          have to be long—a feed, a nappy change, a song or a few minutes of
          cuddles, then into the crib. Same order, same kind of calm, can help.
        </p>
        <h2>Every baby is different</h2>
        <p>
          Some babies sleep in longer stretches early; others need more time. If
          you're worried about your baby's sleep or your own exhaustion, talking
          to your health visitor or GP is always a good step.
        </p>

          real-parent stories. You've got this.
