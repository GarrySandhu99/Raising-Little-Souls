          <h2>A Practical, Parent-Friendly Guide (With 50+ Meal &amp; Snack Ideas)</h2>

          <p>
            When you first start solids with your baby, you hear a lot of advice.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Start with veggies.”</li>
            <li>“Offer allergens early.”</li>
            <li>“Try baby-led weaning.”</li>
            <li>And then — someone says, “Make sure they’re getting enough iron.”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            And suddenly, you’re wondering:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why is iron such a big deal?</li>
            <li>How much does my baby actually need?</li>
            <li>What if they don’t eat much?</li>
            <li>Am I doing this wrong?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Take a deep breath. You’re not behind. You’re not failing. And you absolutely can meet your child’s iron
            needs without complicated meal plans or daily stress. Let’s walk through it together.
          </p>

          <h3>What Is Iron — and Why Does It Matter So Much?</h3>
          <p>
            Iron is a mineral essential for hemoglobin production — the protein in red blood cells that carries
            oxygen throughout the body. Research shows iron is critical for oxygen transport, rapid brain
            development in infancy, myelination of nerves, immune regulation, and muscle metabolism.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Babies Are at Higher Risk for Iron Deficiency</h3>
          <p>
            Infants grow rapidly and their iron needs rise quickly. Higher risk groups include premature infants,
            low birth weight babies, babies born to mothers with anemia, and exclusively breastfed infants without
            iron-rich complementary foods after 6 months.
          </p>

          <h3>How Much Iron Do Babies and Toddlers Actually Need?</h3>
          <p>
            Guidelines: 6–12 months: 11 mg/day; 1–3 years: 7 mg/day; 4–8 years: 10 mg/day. Focus on consistent
            intake across the week rather than perfect daily totals.
          </p>

          <h3>Heme vs Non-Heme Iron</h3>
          <p>
            Heme iron (animal sources) is absorbed more efficiently than non-heme (plant) iron. Both types are valuable,
            and pairing non-heme sources with vitamin C improves absorption.
          </p>

          <h3>Practical Ideas &amp; Meal Suggestions</h3>
          <p>Below are age-appropriate ideas to mix into family meals and snacks.</p>
          <h4>Babies (6–12 months)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Soft ground beef or turkey</li>
            <li>Lentil puree</li>
            <li>Tofu strips, mashed black beans, flaked salmon</li>
            <li>Iron-fortified cereal mixed with fruit</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Toddlers (1–3 years)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Chili with beans</li>
            <li>Spaghetti with meat sauce</li>
            <li>Nut butter sandwiches</li>
            <li>Oatmeal with fruit and seeds</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Older Kids</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Fortified cereal + berries</li>
            <li>Lentil chili</li>
            <li>Roasted chickpeas and trail mix (age-appropriate)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Practical Hacks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use iron-fortified cereal in muffins and pancakes.</li>
            <li>Cook tomato-based foods in cast-iron cookware.</li>
            <li>Pair iron foods with vitamin C rich fruits.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Final thought: Offer variety, pair non-heme iron with vitamin C, and focus on gradual progress rather than perfection.
