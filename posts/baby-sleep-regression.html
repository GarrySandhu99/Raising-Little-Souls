          <h2>The Complete Gentle Survival Guide for Exhausted Parents</h2>
          <p>
            A deeply detailed, practical, and emotionally supportive guide designed to help parents understand
            sleep regressions and confidently respond with gentle structure and reassurance.
          </p>

          <h3>Introduction: When Sleep Suddenly Falls Apart</h3>
          <p>
            One night your baby sleeps relatively well. The next night, everything changes. Frequent wakings,
            crying the moment you put them down, short naps, and an overall sense that sleep has completely
            unraveled. Sleep regressions often feel personal. Parents question themselves. Did I create bad habits?
            Did I miss something? The truth is that regressions are strongly tied to neurological growth and
            developmental leaps.
          </p>

          <h3>What Is a Sleep Regression?</h3>
          <p>
            A sleep regression is a temporary period of disrupted sleep that coincides with major
            developmental milestones. It typically includes increased night wakings, nap resistance, and
            difficulty settling.
          </p>

          <h3>Why Development Disrupts Sleep</h3>
          <p>
            Sleep architecture changes dramatically during the first year. Around four months, babies transition
            from newborn sleep patterns into more complex sleep cycles with distinct light and deep stages.
          </p>

          <h3>Common Ages for Sleep Regressions</h3>
          <p>
            4 Months, 6 Months, 8–10 Months, 12 Months, 18 Months — each window aligns with developmental leaps
            such as rolling, crawling, walking, and emotional growth.
          </p>

          <h3>Understanding the 2–3 Hour Wake Cycle</h3>
          <p>
            Baby sleep cycles typically last between two and three hours. At the end of each cycle, there is a
            natural partial awakening. If your baby falls asleep nursing, bottle-feeding, rocking, or being held,
            they may feel disoriented when they wake in a different environment.
          </p>

          <h3>Hunger or Habit? A Closer Look at Night Feeds</h3>
          <p>
            Night feeding needs vary by age and growth pattern. Younger babies genuinely require overnight
            calories. However, after 9–10 months, many healthy babies can physiologically sleep longer
            stretches without feeding. Gradual reduction works best.
          </p>

          <h3>Gentle and Practical Strategies for Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            Consistency is more powerful than strictness. Choose a calm plan and follow it for at least 1–2
            weeks before evaluating progress. Focus on daytime nutrition, predictable bedtime routines, and
            separating feeding from full sleep.
          </p>

          <h3>The Emotional Impact on Parents</h3>
          <p>
            Chronic sleep fragmentation affects mental health. Irritability, anxiety, and self-doubt are common.
            Normalize these feelings and seek support if overwhelmed.
          </p>

          <h3>How Long Do Sleep Regressions Last?</h3>
          <p>
            Most regressions resolve within two to six weeks once the developmental milestone stabilizes.
            Gentle reshaping of bedtime and night responses typically leads to gradual improvement.
          </p>

          <h3>A Final Word for the 2 AM Parent</h3>
          <p>
            If you are reading this in the middle of the night, know that this stage is temporary.
            You are responding with care. You are building trust. One day, your baby will sleep longer stretches.
