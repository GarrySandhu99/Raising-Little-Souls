        <h1>About Raising Little Souls</h1>
        <div class="content-block">
        <p>I used to think parenting would feel natural. Like love would automatically come with confidence.</p>
        <p>But the truth is… love came first. Confidence came much later.</p>
        <p>There were days I felt like I was guessing everything. Nights I cried quietly because I couldn't figure out why my baby wouldn't settle. Moments when I stared at milestone charts and wondered if my child was "behind," even though deep down I knew every child grows at their own pace.</p>
        <p>I kept telling myself to be grateful. And I was. But I was also exhausted—mentally and physically. I was learning a brand-new life while trying to keep a tiny human alive, comforted, fed, clean, and safe… while still pretending I was "fine."</p>
        <p>Raising Little Souls is the space I wish I had back then.</p>
        <p>It's written from my own real experience—the messy, honest kind. The kind where you love your child with your whole heart, but sometimes you also feel lost, touched-out, and tired in a way you can't explain.</p>
        <p>Here, we talk about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>sleep struggles (waking, regressions, routines, naps)</li>
          <li>feeding worries (milk, solids, picky phases)</li>
          <li>the emotional side of parenting (because that part matters too)</li>
          <li>and gentle recommendations that can make everyday life easier</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This isn't a perfect-parent website.<br />It's a real-parent website.</p>
        <p>If you've ever felt alone in the struggle—welcome. You're exactly who I built this for.</p>
